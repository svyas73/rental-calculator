### Cash-on-Cash ROI
```
Cash-on-Cash ROI = (Annual Cash Flow / Initial Investment) √ó 100
```
This shows the annual return on your initial down payment investment.

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
The discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows equal to zero. It's a comprehensive measure of investment performance that considers the time value of money.

### Net Present Value (NPV)
The present value of all future cash flows minus the initial investment, discounted at your specified discount rate.

### Break-Even Point
The number of years it takes for cumulative cash flow to become positive, indicating when your investment starts generating positive returns.
